- **Digit**: 

To test the siamese network structure works, a simpler network was created to execute MNIST digit data. The network consists of only one side of the original siamese net and was run to test whether it could successfually learn anything.

The results are good as the network can produce a test accuracy of at least 96% on test set (previously unseen) with only 1000 training iterations (tensorflow's original example needs at least 15k iterations to achieve such results)
